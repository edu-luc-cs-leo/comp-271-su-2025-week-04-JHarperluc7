Week 3 Journal

Similarities
We both use arrays as the foundation for our MinHeap implementation.

Both versions support dynamic resizing and track usage.

We each have add() and getSmallest() methods.

The overall logic and structure follow the same goal of managing a priority queue.

Reflection
This week, I can tell my code is getting more structured. Unfortunately I should have used array like in class but my version includes heapifyUp()/ heapifyDown(), which is still affective. My professor’s version doesn’t do this — it finds the smallest by scanning the array, which might be for teaching clarity rather than performance.

I check if indices are valid before using them, and I only resize the array when I actually need to. That makes my code a little longer.

I have a ton of comments. That said, I can see how Professor Leo's style is cleaner and more direct. It shows me where I can eventually go once I’m more comfortable.

General Thoughts
I think data structure is definitely rebuilding my mind since I haven't hard coded in about a year.  It is encouraging to see how much I’ve grown. There’s still a few weeks left, but I’m showing up, staying consistent, and learning through every version. I need to make sure I brush up and study for the exam since its a 53% chance of being called through algorithm.
